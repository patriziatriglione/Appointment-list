Small app to practice during the course of React with Start2Imapct. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can try it [here](https://tourmaline-rabanadas-8cbc59.netlify.app/)

#### Description
The app allows you to enter various appointments, entering information on place, time, day and, if it is marked as "Important", the appointment is surrounded by a red border.
The various appointments are placed one below the other and it is possible to cancel them.

For graphics, I used <b>Reactstrap</b>

### Istructions
It is very simple to use it, just click the button to add the appointment, fill in the various fields present and, by clicking on "insert", it is inserted in the page where it is possible, through the X, to cancel it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
